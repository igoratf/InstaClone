# InstaClone
A (soon to be) clone of Instagram Web

## What is?
A full stack clone of Instagram Web made by my own in MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js).
The meaning of this project is to practice full stack development fundamentals starting a project by scratch on my own, no tutorials followed.
I really like Instagram as an app, so I chose it as a project model to practice my skills and will try to implement it from zero.

## Development steps
I won't implement the whole project itself (Instagram is huge), I've chosen a few main features as a backbone and will develop them starting
from the front-end UI and simple states, using React and Hooks. Later, I will create the back-end with MongoDB, Express and Node.js with Rest API at first
and increment the front-end whenever needed to connect it to the server.

## How to execute?
